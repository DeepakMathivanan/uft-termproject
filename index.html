  <h1>Customer Segmentation with various clustering Alogorithms</h1>
  <p>This project focuses on understanding customer behavior by grouping them based on their shopping patterns. It analyzes how 
     often customers buy, how recently they made a purchase, how much they typically spend, and how often they return items. By 
     studying these patterns, we can identify different types of customers, such as regular buyers, high spenders, or those who 
     may be at risk of not returning.This helps the business tailor its marketing, improve customer service, and make more informed 
     decisions to boost customer satisfaction and sales. </p>
