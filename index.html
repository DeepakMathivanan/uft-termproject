    <!-- Optional description -->
    <p>This project focuses on understanding customer behavior by grouping them based on their shopping patterns. It analyzes how 
       often customers buy, how recently they made a purchase, how much they typically spend, and how often they return items. By 
       studying these patterns, we can identify different types of customers, such as regular buyers, high spenders, or those who 
       may be at risk of not returning. This helps the business tailor its marketing, improve customer service, and make more informed 
       decisions to boost customer satisfaction and sales.</p>

        <h2>Using K-Means</h2>
        <p>We prepared customer data by generating features like Recency, Frequency, Monetary, and others. After scaling the data and 
           using the K-distance graph to find optimal eps and min_samples, we applied DBSCAN to identify natural customer groupings. 
           This method helped detect outliers and clusters without predefining the number of segments. PCA was used for 2D visualization 
           of the clusters.</p>

        <h2>Using DBSCAN</h2>
        <p>For KMeans, we used the same preprocessed and scaled data. We applied the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of 
           clusters (K), then used KMeans to classify customers into distinct groups. Each group was analyzed and labeled based on 
           behavioral traits like high spending or frequent purchases, helping us create meaningful customer segments.</p>
